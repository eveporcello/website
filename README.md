### Using AWS Dev endpoint
If you have taken the time to clone and deploy the [graphql-lambda](https://github.com/HighFivesFoundation/graphql-lambda) backend, you can use your own dev environment by adding an environment variable called `REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT`,

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project
2. Add the following declaration to that file:

```
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=<YOUR ENDPOINT HERE>
```
